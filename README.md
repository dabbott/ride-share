### ride-share

Components used in the Deco Uber demo. Not intended to run as a standalone project. Published on npm as `deco-ride-share-demo`.

If you still want to run as a standalone project in Deco, `cd` into the project directory, then run:

```
npm install react-native
```

If building the project fails, consider deleting the `ios` directory, creating a new Deco project, and copying the `ios` directory from the new project into this one.
